 * ActionListener is an interface from Java Swing.
 * GUI components can have one or more action listeners
 * add to them.
 *
 * When a GUI component's "action" is performed (a button
 * is clicked, a checkbox is checked, etc.), that
 * component will notify all of its listeners. It will
 * call the actionPerformed method implemented below.
 *
 * It's then up to the listener implementation (like
 * HeatWaveAction or ColdWaveAction) to do whatever it's
 * job is, like increase or decrease the temperature.
